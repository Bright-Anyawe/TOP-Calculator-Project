# TOP-Calculator-Project
- create functions for the following items and testing them in your browser’s console:
add
subtract
multiply
divide

- Create three variables for each of the parts of a calculator operation. 
- Create a variable for the first number, the operator, and the second number,
- You’ll use these variables to update your display later.

- Create a new function (operate) that takes an operator and 2 numbers
 and then calls one of the above functions on the numbers.

 - Create a basic HTML calculator with buttons for each digit, each of the above functions
  and an “Equals” key.
 
 - Create the functions that populate the display when you click the number buttons.
  You should be storing the ‘display value’ in a variable somewhere for use in the next step.

- Make the calculator work! You’ll need to store the first number and second number
 that are input into the calculator, utilize the operator that the user selects,
  and then operate() on the two numbers when the user presses the “=” key.
